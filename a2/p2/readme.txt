To compile ACS, type 'make'. In the command prompt. This will generate an
executable ACS. To execute, type "./ACS <filename>".
A sample input text file customers.txt is included for testing purposes.
Read the specifications of ACS for details on how to write a customers file.
ACS assumes input will be formatted as specified, and it only considers
negative numbers to be invalid input.
